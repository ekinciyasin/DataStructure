# Java Data Structure Models

This repository contains various Java implementations of common data structures along with sorting algorithms.

## Data Structures Included:

- **Array**: Basic array operations and algorithms.
- **Linked List**: Singly linked list and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Stack**: Implementation of stack data structure.
- **Queue**: Implementation of queue data structure.
- **Tree**: Binary tree and binary search tree implementations.
- **Graph**: Basic graph representation and traversal algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Included:

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted, and then repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.
- **Insertion Sort**: Sorting algorithm that builds a sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.
- **Merge Sort**: Divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sublists according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the sublists.

## Usage:

Each data structure and sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Java file within the `src` directory. 

## Contributions:

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional data structures or sorting algorithms to contribute, feel free to open a pull request.
